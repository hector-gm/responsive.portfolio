Basic responsive portfolio incorporating Bootstrap framework

This repo is simply an example of a portfolio website utilizing the Bootstrap framework to link its CSS and JavaScript library to style these pages and enable responsiveness.

Placeholder text is used in lieu of actual personal information. 

The purpose of this is to provide practice to develop a personal portfolio with my own personal details and style touch as I learn more.

## Credits

As mentioned above, this sample exercise incorporates the Bootstrap framework (specifically version 4.5) and was sourced from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/

Extensive reading in the Bootstrap guides and tutorials [Bootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/) were referenced to put together this newbie attempt. 

Additionally had to rewatch class video to confirm I wasn't too lost. Thank you @eapostol for those links!
